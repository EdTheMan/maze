The extra credit was actually interesting and fun. It is very different than the other assignments we have done and especially different to the nanotwitter project. What was hard was creating the maze generator. I tried using the backtrack algorthim to generate the maze but could not get it to work. Also, just making sure to design the program well, avoiding smelly code, and creating the test suite was a bit hard. I wasn't sure what to exactly test using rspec. I also learned a lot about ruby programming features and implementing algorthims.
